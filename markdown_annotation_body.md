\[1a\] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. May the
prayers of God Most High be upon his noble prophet and his family, peace
be upon them.

This text is *The Guide for the Heedless* by the learned Imam Sīdī ʿAbd
Allāh ibn al-Ḥājj Ibrāhīm

a) All praise belongs to God, who led us

    b) to the truth and away from falsehood, and denied us

a) What the best of the honored ones forbade us

    b) may our Lord bring him peace and pray upon him.

\[Falsehood\] incurs disapproval and prohibition,[^1]

within it all the sciences of evil are discerned.

It includes conferring on someone a benefit or an affliction,

which, according to law, is not deserved,

Or peering into the realm of the unseen 5

or deploying a name for a worldly decree.

To masters of the sciences of evil, bring the good news -

of their humiliating poverty and grim fate.[^2]

*Hīmiyyā, sīmiyyā,* and *ruqiyyas* known

to harm are considered sorcery -

Celestial is the first, and the second is,

like oil and ointment, of the earth -

As are some properties of realities when

their power over souls (*nufūs*) is proven,

Like the pollen of a date palm, the hairs stuck in a comb,[^3] 10

and a dog's biting of seven stones,

And engraving names with a link, so they claim,

to a planet or a celestial sphere, "a talisman" let's say,

On any substance with a soul (*nafs*) that is suitable.

And in the adjurations a defect is found

From ignorance of the divine names by which

the adjured angels are bound.

For the *jinn* and the planets there are "evocations," let's say,

with perfumes and clothes specific to each,

Most of it is apostasy - no success can one reap 15

When to evil he inclines.

It includes sand writing, forms, and birth-charts,

along with omens and the casting of lots

If used for acquisition, even when found in a book.

Scalpomancy is, by some, included in its number,

And it also includes music and thunder.

Scrying and fortune-telling are of no use -

Those are reports about the past and

events to come. So beware and leave them alone!

By tradition, it is classified as apostasy, 20

whether by speech, by creed, or by deed.

\[1b\] And permitted things, like a comb, might be mixed

with things forbidden, like illicit sex.

Sorcery produces hate and likewise love it can instill.

It forces changes to a body and it can kill,

And compel stupidity, and turn a person

into something else, like a horse or a donkey.

Along a slender thread \[the sorcerer\] can flow.

He flies and shrinks until through a peephole he can go.

A *sughniyyā* sucks the blood out of the heart, 25

just as an imposter draws it out by an attractive art.

As in India, it can occur naturally,

[ ]{dir="rtl"} but most achieve it painstakingly.

Separating someone from their possessions can be commissioned,

among both the Jews and others it has been witnessed.

But sorcery is blocked from accomplishing certain things,

like killing, or sprouting crops, instantly, or splitting the seas -

Or - those who have \[true\] knowledge say - learning about the unseen,
curing the blind,

speaking foreign tongues, or bringing the dead to life.

The science of treasure and the science of alchemy [ ]{dir="rtl"} 30

they have warned you about and afraid of God you should be.

Counted among it are the raptures of singing,

intoned by a singer, his raising voice lifting.[^4]

In this the listener and the singer are the same,

those hidden and apparent agree in what they say

About the permitted, the prohibited, and the conditional, which depends,

on whether or not \[the singing\] is combined with an instrument.

If so, then it is forbidden, everyone agrees -

unlike those instances that are permitted, like [ ]{dir="rtl"} longing

For God, or for joyous occasions such as banquets, holidays, and acts of
celebration 35

of the day of someone's return or \[the Qur'ān's\] memorization,

Or for weddings, or to encourage the birth, or celebrate the arrival, of
a child,

or listening to the songs of the camel-driver, or to quote a poem

That is not connected to anything that has to do

with descriptions of wine, or slander, or satire,

Or without an instrument, in the style of the singing of the Arabs who,

[ ]{dir="rtl"} gave it the name "al-Naṣb" -

\[For these\], no difference in legal judgement will you find

for versified Arabic or songs that are linguistically unrefined.

Even now, people gather for *dhikr*

and to recite the Qurʾān across the lands.[^5] 40

His sound text refutes the one who disapproved,

ignorance of what became apparent is his excuse.

One should hold to it fast,

That perception might the Most Beautiful grasp.

But authorization to do it out loud will be based

on the lack of something prohibited, like conceit, taking place.

In this, it is like waking someone or mingling socially,

as the alert ones related along with similar things.

\[2a\] Indeed, \[*dhikr*\] awakens the hearts of the heedless 45

and increases the ignorant in labor and learning.

So hold it close, morning and evening,

with the masters of exemplary guidance.

And one might lighten the load of the one who recites,

for some consider that to be right.

But \[*dhikr*\] does have a condition - it must be free of what is
prohibited

and things whose rejection has been decreed.

And women are prohibited from attending,

or at least should not be perceived,

Whether physically or orally. So recite to the people 50

\[these\] three verses by Abū ʿAbbās[^6]:

"During \[*dhikr*\], it is not the way of men to dance

without feeling the state's oncoming rush.

And whoever is strong enough to hold still

will be spared from suspicious thoughts.

There it has not been permitted to smile,

to joke, or \[even\] to talk"

Or to peer about or at a participant stare.

One should not hear a sound,

Or hem and haw, or move around, 55

If restraint is possible for you.

In city mosques, where one fears the disturbance,

Restraining from \[*dhikr*\] is among the acts of the virtuous,

As is the bowing of heads, and it

can be done standing, without restriction.

Among them is purification and freshening the room it is in,

as well as one's clothes, for the sake of believing *jinn*.

When gathering for *dhikr* or for learning, it is the proper etiquette

to form a circle out of those who sit.

On meeting outside the proper time we can agree, 60

if the appointed hour passed by unintentionally.

*The Guide for the Heedless* has been completed,

A piece of advice from me to all the heedless

All praise belongs to God for finishing it

and its commentary, to the conclusion from the first hemistich.

Then may the prayers and peace of God

Be upon the one who guided all mankind

And his family, his companions -- the best community,

The well-spring of knowledge and the mine of nobility.

[^1]: Prohibition (*manʿ*) and disapproval (*kurḥ*) are technical legal
    terms. Prohibited acts are forbidden, while acts that merit
    disapproval are discouraged.

    manuscript but is found at this location in all four copies of the
    commentary that I consulted. For one example, see ʿAbd Allāh ibn
    Ibrāhīm al-ʿAlawī, "Sharḥ rushd al-rhāfil," BnF MS Arabe 5599
    (Paris), fo. 44b.

[^3]: The pollen of the date-palm tree and the "comb with the hairs
    stuck to it" are both referenced in a *ḥadith* that relates how the
    prophet was ensorcelled by a man named Labīd ibn al-Aʿṣam. See See
    al-Bukhārī, *Ṣaḥīḥ*, *k. al-ṭibb*, 47.

    Arabe 5599 (Paris), fo. 51b.

[^6]: In his commentary, Sīdī ʿAbd Allah refers to him as Ibn Zakrī,
    which would make him Abū ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Maghrāwī
    al-Tilimsānī (d. 900/1494). This Ibn Zakrī was a judge and a scholar
    of Islamic law, theology, and the Arabic language in Tlemcen. He was
    also the teacher of some celebrated Sufis, including Aḥmad Zarrūq
    (d. 899/1493). Élise Voguet, "Ibn Zakrī al-Tilimsānī," *EI~3~
