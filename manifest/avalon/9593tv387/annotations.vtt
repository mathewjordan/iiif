<p>1. Sidney had married Shirley Levine (1917-1990) and they had a daughter, Phyllis, in 1943. U.S. draft policies in World War II were such that, with a wife and child, Sidney was not immediately drafted. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, also known as the Burke–Wadsworth Act, enacted September 16, 1940, “was the first peacetime conscription in United States history. This Selective Service Act required that men who had reached their 21st birthday but had not yet reached their 36th birthday register with local draft boards. Later, when the U.S. entered World War II, all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 45th birthday were made subject to military service, and all men from their 18th birthday until the day before their 65th birthday were required to register.… By the early summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months to a total of thirty months, plus any additional time that he could deem necessary for national security…. After the United States entered World War II, amendments to the Selective Training and Service Act on December 20, 1941, made all men between the ages of 20 and 44 liable for military service, and required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register.… From October 1940 until March 1947, when the wartime Selective Training and Service Act expired after extensions by Congress, over 10,000,000 men were inducted.” More broadly, the U.S. federal government has turned to the draft six times in history (American Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts). Conscription came to an end only in 1973 when the United States Armed Forces became all-voluntary. See “Selective Training and the Selective Service Act of 1940, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Training_and_Service_Act_of_1940 (accessed 21 March 2022). From October 1940 until March 1947“49 million men had been registered, 36 million classified, and 10 million inducted.” See “Conscription in the United States” at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States (accessed 21 March 2022).</p>
