WEBVTT

0:00:01.480 --> 0:00:03.660
Okay, so we're going to do a little demo of AMP.

0:00:04.100 --> 0:00:07.000
So we're going to start with creating a workflow. So I'm here in AMP.

0:00:07.160 --> 0:00:10.260
I'm going to come in and create a new workflow.

0:00:16.360 --> 0:00:21.040
And we're going to call this workflow transcripts,

0:00:21.080 --> 0:00:23.600
AWS transcribe, and whisper.

0:00:25.380 --> 0:00:28.560
We're going to use this workflow to create transcripts from

0:00:28.560 --> 0:00:30.840
both modules. Okay,

0:00:30.940 --> 0:00:34.020
so here is the workflow editor that's being provided by

0:00:34.020 --> 0:00:36.520
Galaxy, which is our open source project.

0:00:44.860 --> 0:00:46.700
Okay, so we're going to create a workflow here.

0:00:46.820 --> 0:00:48.660
First thing I'm going to do is get some data.

0:00:49.860 --> 0:00:53.320
And then we're going to grab our audio from it because we're in transcripts.

0:00:53.480 --> 0:00:56.500
So what we need is the audio from the input

0:00:56.500 --> 0:00:57.980
file. And the next step,

0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:00.700
we're going to come to the speech to text section.

0:01:01.000 --> 0:01:04.340
You can see we have AWS transcribe as one of our metadata

0:01:04.340 --> 0:01:08.160
generation tools. And then we also have whisper as

0:01:08.160 --> 0:01:10.840
one of our metadata generation tools. So I'm going to add them both in here.

0:01:10.920 --> 0:01:13.660
So it'll be creating transcripts via two different mechanisms.

0:01:13.660 --> 0:01:16.900
And we'll connect to the audio from

0:01:16.900 --> 0:01:18.500
the source up to both of them.

0:01:18.900 --> 0:01:21.620
We really only need the transcripts,

0:01:21.680 --> 0:01:24.100
so we don't need these other types of outputs.

0:01:24.960 --> 0:01:28.420
And then whisper is capable of producing a web VTT file,

0:01:28.660 --> 0:01:31.080
but AWS transcribe,

0:01:31.340 --> 0:01:33.960
we need to do conversion to web VTT.

0:01:34.200 --> 0:01:35.680
So I'll add that bit on here.

0:01:35.940 --> 0:01:39.340
And I'll pass along the diarization and the transcript

0:01:39.340 --> 0:01:40.220
that's been generated.

0:01:41.920 --> 0:01:44.960
Okay, we don't need that. Okay, so we have a simple workflow here.

0:01:45.100 --> 0:01:46.140
We've got our input coming in.

0:01:46.320 --> 0:01:49.560
We've got our audio going to both speech to text to generate web

0:01:49.560 --> 0:01:52.760
VTT and then also going to AWS transcribe

0:01:52.760 --> 0:01:54.500
to generate a web VTT.

0:01:55.060 --> 0:01:57.700
We've named this whisper, we've named this.

0:02:02.380 --> 0:02:04.180
Transcripts, AWS transcribe and whisper,

0:02:04.440 --> 0:02:07.460
and then we're going to add a tag here to make sure that it is

0:02:07.460 --> 0:02:07.980
published.

0:02:19.780 --> 0:02:21.760
And then while that's going to click done here.

0:02:22.900 --> 0:02:24.460
And now that we've created this workflow,

0:02:24.560 --> 0:02:27.000
we're going to go actually go back and run this workflow.

0:02:27.000 --> 0:02:30.180
So we can go ahead and select this from workflow. Here it is,

0:02:30.540 --> 0:02:33.600
right here. And we're going to go ahead and type in,

0:02:33.980 --> 0:02:37.400
we're going to put in one of our Clio collection files from

0:02:37.400 --> 0:02:40.520
1967. These are the

0:02:40.520 --> 0:02:43.320
35 millimeter winners from the US 1967.

0:02:44.340 --> 0:02:47.480
We'll go ahead and add that file, and we can run the workflow.

0:02:48.140 --> 0:02:49.620
Okay, so that workflow is submitted.

0:02:50.500 --> 0:02:53.440
And we can go and see that'll probably take a few minutes to run.

0:02:53.440 --> 0:02:55.020
And then we can go into the dashboard.

0:02:55.400 --> 0:02:59.560
So dashboard here and amp shows the outputs from all

0:02:59.560 --> 0:03:02.580
different workflows that have been submitted by different people into the past

0:03:02.580 --> 0:03:03.920
and can be filtered.

0:03:04.140 --> 0:03:07.260
So if we wanted to we could come in here and filter this by for the

0:03:07.260 --> 0:03:08.880
file that we just submitted.

0:03:10.060 --> 0:03:12.080
Here's the 35 millimeter award winners.

0:03:12.400 --> 0:03:13.760
We can see only these files.

0:03:14.220 --> 0:03:17.340
And then we can take a look at the output. So if you look here,

0:03:17.680 --> 0:03:21.340
we got a web

0:03:21.340 --> 0:03:24.080
VTT file created by whisper here.

0:03:24.500 --> 0:03:27.600
And so this can be just saved down to your computer as one way to get

0:03:27.600 --> 0:03:27.940
the file.
