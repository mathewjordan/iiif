I suppose that he went to Gen. Buels Headquarters to see if we were coming down there soon, (as our Brigade is under Gen Buels Command), and of coarse Gen Buel told him what to do, in the fight of Pitsburgh Landing. Many Regiments lost all their field Officers and many Companies lost all their Commandants. and I heard that Sheldon is Commanding a Company, in an Ohio Regiment near Corinth. I heard also that our forces were driven back 4 miles at Corinth. I suppose if they need help at Corinth, that we shall go there. but I do not know. in fact we do not know where we are going at any time till we get there."
